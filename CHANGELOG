** 1.4.x

1.3.5 --> 1.4.0
===============

* The AST node for Proc in the simple AST is changed to include a SrcLoc argument,
  to make it consistent with similar nodes e.g. Lambda. This is specifically needed
  for transformation of patterns in HSX.


** 1.3.x

1.3.4 --> 1.3.5
===============

* Added an entry point in the parser for statements, and an instance Parseable Stmt
  to go with it.

* Ensured that .Annotated exports all relevant parseXXX(WithYYY) functions.

1.3.3 --> 1.3.4
===============

* Operator fixities are now resolved in patterns.

1.3.2 --> 1.3.3
===============

* Fixes a bug where qualified keywords are rejected even if the extension that
  enables the keyword in question is not turned on.


1.3.0 --> 1.3.2
===============

(Let's forget 1.3.1 ever existed.)

* Fix a bug where declarations of infix operators were not properly merged as FunBinds.
