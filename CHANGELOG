** 1.9.x

1.8.2 --> 1.9.0
===============

* OptionPragma is renamed to the more descriptive ModulePragma,
  and adds a constructor AnnModulePragma for handling ANN pragmas
  preceding module header.

* Add instances for Eq/Ord/Data/Typeable for Fixity.

* More informative error messages when HSX tags are mismatched.


** 1.8.x

1.8.1 --> 1.8.2
===============

* Don't insert redundant parentheses around record constructions
  and updates.

1.8.0 --> 1.8.1
===============

* Fix three bugs with the handling of ANN. I must have been really
  tired when implementing that support.

1.7.2 --> 1.8.0
===============

* Add an instance Show Fixity (derived).

* Support for the new ANN and INLINE_CONLIKE pragmas.

* Export knownExtensions from .Extension.

* Remove support for CFILES and INCLUDE pragmas. The support wasn't 
  correct anyway, as it assumed the pragmas appeared at the top of 
  files. As CFILES/INCLUDE pragmas can (and do) appear anywhere, 
  there's no hope to support them in the AST. Better to remove the 
  support altogether. Files with CFILES/INCLUDE pragmas can still 
  be parsed of course, but those pragmas will be handled as comments.

* Parsing with ignoreLinePragmas = False now correctly updates the
  file name.

* Allow the whole SPECIALISE/INLINE family of pragmas in instance
  declarations. The InsInline constructor is removed, and is now
  represented by InsDecl (InlineSig ...).

* Fix a bug with line numbering and quasi quotes, and a similar one 
  with line numbering and CDATA.

* Fix a few minor bugs in the exactPrinter.

* Fix the strange handling of so called strings in LINE pragmas.

** 1.7.x

1.7.1 --> 1.7.2
===============

* Fixes a bug in lexing LINE pragmas (used when ignoreLinePragmas
  is set to False).

1.7.0 --> 1.7.1
===============

* UnicodeSyntax now also enables the forall symbol (U+2200).

1.6.1 --> 1.7.0
===============

* Operators defined on the form
  
     (a `op` b) c = ...
  
  could not be handled by the (annotated) AST, nor the parser. I had to 
  change the definition of the AST node for InfixMatch to allow a list
  of right-hand subpatterns, i.e.
  
     InfixMatch l (Pat l) (Name l) (Pat l) ...
  
  has become
  
     InfixMatch l (Pat l) (Name l) [Pat l] ...

  I also had an epiphany and fixed the issue that would arise with
  exact printing of prefix definitions including parentheses, so 
  that now works too!

** 1.6.x

1.6.0 --> 1.6.1
===============

* UnicodeSyntax now works not only for identifiers, but also for
  ->, <- and =>, as well as Arrows arrows and kind stars.

1.5.3 --> 1.6.0
===============

* (=~=) turns out to be too general at Functor (for intuitive and not
  technical reasons), so is specialised to Annotated to closer mirror
  the original intention.

* applyFixities is hoisted to a monad, and now fails on ambiguous infix
  expressions.

** 1.5.x

1.5.2 --> 1.5.3
===============

* Several small bug fixes in the exact printer, and fail more gracefully
  if the number of srcInfoPoints doesn't match the needs of the node.

1.5.1 --> 1.5.2
===============

* Fix a bug in the exact printer that made it always print the first token
  at position (0,0).

* In fixing the above, Annotated is now a superclass of ExactP. It was already
  a superclass in spirit, and nothing can break from this since ExactP is only
  exported abstractly.

1.5.0 --> 1.5.1
===============

* The pretty printer now introduces parentheses for non-atomic arguments to
  function application. Note that infix applications are left untouched, no
  parentheses will be inserted there, as it is assumed that fixities are
  already properly resolved.

* Fix a bug in the pretty printer where view patterns and n+k patterns were
  not properly parenthesised.

1.4.0 --> 1.5.0
===============

* Add support for acting on LINE pragmas while parsing, i.e. updating the source
  position according to info given in LINE pragmas. This is done conditionally
  based on a new flag ignoreLinePragmas in the ParseMode, hence the need to
  increase the major version.

** 1.4.x

1.3.5 --> 1.4.0
===============

* The AST node for Proc in the simple AST is changed to include a SrcLoc argument,
  to make it consistent with similar nodes e.g. Lambda. This is specifically needed
  for transformation of patterns in HSX.


** 1.3.x

1.3.4 --> 1.3.5
===============

* Added an entry point in the parser for statements, and an instance Parseable Stmt
  to go with it.

* Ensured that .Annotated exports all relevant parseXXX(WithYYY) functions.

1.3.3 --> 1.3.4
===============

* Operator fixities are now resolved in patterns.

1.3.2 --> 1.3.3
===============

* Fixes a bug where qualified keywords are rejected even if the extension that
  enables the keyword in question is not turned on.


1.3.0 --> 1.3.2
===============

(Let's forget 1.3.1 ever existed.)

* Fix a bug where declarations of infix operators were not properly merged as FunBinds.
