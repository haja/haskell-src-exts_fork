** 1.5.x

1.5.2 --> 1.5.3
===============

* Several small bug fixes in the exact printer, and fail more gracefully
  if the number of srcInfoPoints doesn't match the needs of the node.

1.5.1 --> 1.5.2
===============

* Fix a bug in the exact printer that made it always print the first token
  at position (0,0).

* In fixing the above, Annotated is now a superclass of ExactP. It was already
  a superclass in spirit, and nothing can break from this since ExactP is only
  exported abstractly.

1.5.0 --> 1.5.1
===============

* The pretty printer now introduces parentheses for non-atomic arguments to
  function application. Note that infix applications are left untouched, no
  parentheses will be inserted there, as it is assumed that fixities are
  already properly resolved.

* Fix a bug in the pretty printer where view patterns and n+k patterns were
  not properly parenthesised.

1.4.0 --> 1.5.0
===============

* Add support for acting on LINE pragmas while parsing, i.e. updating the source
  position according to info given in LINE pragmas. This is done conditionally
  based on a new flag ignoreLinePragmas in the ParseMode, hence the need to
  increase the major version.

** 1.4.x

1.3.5 --> 1.4.0
===============

* The AST node for Proc in the simple AST is changed to include a SrcLoc argument,
  to make it consistent with similar nodes e.g. Lambda. This is specifically needed
  for transformation of patterns in HSX.


** 1.3.x

1.3.4 --> 1.3.5
===============

* Added an entry point in the parser for statements, and an instance Parseable Stmt
  to go with it.

* Ensured that .Annotated exports all relevant parseXXX(WithYYY) functions.

1.3.3 --> 1.3.4
===============

* Operator fixities are now resolved in patterns.

1.3.2 --> 1.3.3
===============

* Fixes a bug where qualified keywords are rejected even if the extension that
  enables the keyword in question is not turned on.


1.3.0 --> 1.3.2
===============

(Let's forget 1.3.1 ever existed.)

* Fix a bug where declarations of infix operators were not properly merged as FunBinds.
