* 0.4.1
=========
New major branch:

- The AST has been cleaned up, by splitting Haskell expressions in
the AST from the "expressions" used while parsing to represent both
expressions and patterns.

- The ugly Hs prefixes on datatypes in the AST have been removed.
Datatypes are now named Exp, Pat, Module (former Module is now ModuleName),
Type and QOp etc, instead of HsExp, HsPat... .

- Support for magic hash identifiers
